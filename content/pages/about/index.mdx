Hi!

We all know owning a business in Nigeria can be frustrating😤. I can't even begin to mention the many obstacles small business owners like myself face daily. I'm not here to throw a pity party. Nope. Far from it; I mean, what's life without a little drama😉?

Instead, I'm here to take you on a journey, with my lovely self😊 as to how and why I do what I do. I believe every dress should tell a story. 
I'm here to introduce you to my world of fabrics, and threads, and designs beyond wildest imaginations. 
While I'm at it, I'd also give you a sneak peak into the life of an average Nigerian Tailor. And hey, what’s a blog without some rant and banter?😅. 
Expect all of this, and more!

So without further ado....drum rolls... Welcome to my Blog💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾🎊🎉🎈🎊🎉🥂.

My name is Aderinsola...A.K.A The Fabric Doctor😁 (I hope it’s as cool as it sounds in my ears!). It wouldn’t take an Einstein to figure that Medicine is my side hustle🤓! I’m a square peg in a round hole y’all😂😂. I promise I'll fill in all the blanks as time goes on. 
I have a fashion business, Quintessential Couture, which caters for female apparels only, for now. In time, I hope to delve into Male Fashion too.

Okay, I guess this marks the end of my introduction. This is my first attempt at writing for a "wide audience", so I won't call myself a writer per se. You don't know how glad I am that you read this article to this point. Thanks guys❤
